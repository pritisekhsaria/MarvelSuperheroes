# MarvelSuperheroes

My Marvel Superheroes website is one camp, from a series of camps, designed to learn Web Development through projects.
This interactive website camp is designed to introduce students to the concept of web development. After doing this camp, if students are interested, we can schedule a more detailed course, in which we will cover all topics in depth. Another way to study further would be to do similar camps, slowly progressing in level of difficulty.


Please find attached the link for the interactive website. I request you to see the site on a computer as its not responsive. Also, you will not be able to see the hover effects on your phone.

Features of the project:
•	Landing Page/Home page: When we hover over the 3 image blocks, the heading background color changes.
•	Spiderman page: Banner images rotate (we will code this effect using JavaScript)
•	Iron man: We have used the concept of list and animated bullet points
•	Captain Marvel: We will display data using tables. When you hover over the images, the image changes and displays a black & white version of the same photo.
